Be Authentic: Your USP should be truthful and achievable. Overpromising and underdelivering will damage your credibility and reputation.

Use Your USP Consistently: Once you have a strong USP, use it consistently across all your marketing materials, presentations, and pitches. This will reinforce your message and make it more recognizable.

In your pitch, you should introduce your USP early on, ideally within the first few minutes. It should be a key part of your introduction, as it sets the stage for why your software project is worth the audience's time and investment. Make sure your USP is supported by evidence or examples that demonstrate its validity.

For example, if you are pitching a new project management software, your USP might be: "Our software is the only project management tool that integrates real-time collaboration with AI-driven predictive analytics, ensuring your team stays ahead of deadlines and under budget."
